# Why Should We Code?

Coding is a fundamental skill in today's digital world. Here are a few reasons why learning to code is important:

- **Problem Solving:** Coding teaches you how to break down complex problems and find logical solutions.
- **Creativity:** It allows you to build your own applications, games, and websites from scratch.
- **Career Opportunities:** Many high-demand jobs require programming skills.
- **Automation:** Coding helps automate repetitive tasks, saving time and effort.
- **Understanding Technology:** It gives you a deeper understanding of how software and devices work.

Whether you want to pursue a career in tech or simply understand the world better, coding is a valuable skill to learn.

## What is REPL in Python?

REPL stands for **Read-Eval-Print Loop**. It's an interactive environment where you can type Python code, have it executed immediately, and see the result.

For example, you can enter the following in a Python REPL:

```python 
'hello world'

repr ( 'hello world') 

```

This will display the prompt `hello world ` and wait for your input.

## Mathematical Operations in Python  

## Sample Python REPL Session

Below is an example of how you can perform mathematical operations in the Python REPL:

```
>>> 1+5
6
>>> 6-3
3
>>> 9/3
3.0
>>> 20/3
6.666666666666667
>>> 20//3
6
>>> 20%3
2
>>> 20*5
100
>>> 2*2*2*2
16
>>> 2**4
16
>>> 3*5+2
17
>>> 3*(5+2)
21
>>>
```
## Structure of Mathematical Operations: operands and operators

In Python, a mathematical operation consists of:

- **Operands:** The values or variables being operated on (e.g., `3`, `5`, `2`).
- **Operators:** The symbols that specify the operation (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`).

### Examples from above:

- `20 // 3`  
    - Operands: `20`, `3`
    - Operator: `//` (floor division)

- `2 ** 4`  
    - Operands: `2`, `4`
    - Operator: `**` (exponentiation)



These examples show how operands and operators combine to form mathematical expressions in Python.
