# Why Should We Code?

Coding is a fundamental skill in today's digital world. Here are a few reasons why learning to code is important:

- **Problem Solving:** Coding teaches you how to break down complex problems and find logical solutions.
- **Creativity:** It allows you to build your own applications, games, and websites from scratch.
- **Career Opportunities:** Many high-demand jobs require programming skills.
- **Automation:** Coding helps automate repetitive tasks, saving time and effort.
- **Understanding Technology:** It gives you a deeper understanding of how software and devices work.

Whether you want to pursue a career in tech or simply understand the world better, coding is a valuable skill to learn.

## What is REPL in Python?

REPL stands for **Read-Eval-Print Loop**. It's an interactive environment where you can type Python code, have it executed immediately, and see the result.

For example, you can enter the following in a Python REPL:

```python 
'hello world'
input('hello world ')
repr ( 'hello world') 
str ('hello world')
```

### Differences Between `'hello world'`, `input('hello world ')`, `repr('hello world')`, and `str('hello world')`

| Expression                  | Description                                                                 | Output                |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| `'hello world'`             | A string literal; just returns the string itself.                           | `'hello world'`       |
| `input('hello world ')`     | Displays the prompt and waits for user input.                               | User's input (string) |
| `repr('hello world')`       | Returns a string with quotes, showing how it would be typed in code.        | `"'hello world'"`     |
| `str('hello world')`        | Returns the string in a readable form (no extra quotes).                    | `'hello world'`       |

- Use `'hello world'` to represent a string.
- Use `input('hello world ')` to prompt the user.
- Use `repr()` to get the string's representation (useful for debugging).
- Use `str()` to get a readable version of the string.

This will display the prompt `hello world ` and wait for your input.
